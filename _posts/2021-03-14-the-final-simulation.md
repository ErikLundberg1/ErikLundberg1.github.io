### The result
As the due date of the project is tomorrow, the final result of the simulation can now be presented in the video below. The best way to see how the simulation works, since I did not use any quantitative measures, is to visualy compare it to how real traffic would look an a road with similar conditions. If the simulation is compared to real traffic, the result is similar, but not identical, so there is definetly some improvements that can still be made. With regards to the prior post, I did not have enough time to do all of the improvements I would have wanted, since I had the report, among other things, to do. However, some minor improvements were made to the simulation.
