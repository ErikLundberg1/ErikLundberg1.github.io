### The result
As the due date of the project is tomorrow, the final result of the simulation can now be presented. The best way to see how the simulation works, since I did not use any quantitative measures, is to visualy compare it to how real traffic would look an a road with similar conditions. With regards to the prior post, I did not have time to do much more improvements, since I had the report, among other things to do. However, some minor improvements were made.
